  DEPRECATION: Legacy editable install of chamfer==2.0.0 from file:///fsys1/home/rkaharly/treePoinTr/extensions/chamfer_dist (setup.py develop) is deprecated. pip 25.3 will enforce this behaviour change. A possible replacement is to add a pyproject.toml or enable --use-pep517, and use setuptools >= 64. If the resulting installation is not behaving as expected, try using --config-settings editable_mode=compat. Please consult the setuptools documentation for more information. Discussion can be found at https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/11457
